\subsection{Operating Modes}
\label{S:OPENBDLMRUNNINGMODES}
OpenBDLM has two operating modes: \emph{interactive mode} and \emph{batch mode}. In \emph{interactive mode}, OpenBDLM takes the required input for the project through \MATLAB{} command line queries. Each input is validated after pressing the Enter key $\dlsh$. In \emph{batch mode}, the inputs are provided in advance by the user and stored in a cell array of characters vector. OpenBDLM reads sequentially the inputs and performs the analysis. The batch mode requires the user to be familiar with the interactive mode because the set of input must be provided prior to the analysis.
