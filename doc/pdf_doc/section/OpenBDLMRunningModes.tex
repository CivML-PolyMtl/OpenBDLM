\section{OpenBDLM modes}
\label{S:OPENBDLMRUNNINGMODES}

\subsection{Interactive mode}
\label{SS:InteractiveMode}

In the interactive mode, OpenBDLM takes the required input for the project through \MATLAB{} command line queries.
% requests and reads input from the user.
%The input must be provided from the keyboard and be typed in the Matlab command line.
Each input is validated after pressing the Enter key $\dlsh$.

\subsection{Batch mode}
\label{SS:Batchmode}

In the batch mode, the inputs are provided in advance by the user and stored in a cell array of characters vector.
OpenBDLM reads sequentially the inputs and performs the analysis.  %silently as requested from the inputs.
The batch mode requires the user to be familiar with the interactive mode because the set of input must be provided prior to the analysis.
