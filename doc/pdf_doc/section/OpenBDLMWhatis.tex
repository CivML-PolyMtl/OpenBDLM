\section{What is OpenBDLM ?}
\label{S:OPENBDLMWHATIS}

OpenBDLM is a \MATLAB{} open-source software developed to use Bayesian Dynamic Linear Models for long-term time series analysis (i.e time step in the order of one hour or higher).
OpenBDLM is capable to process simultaneously several time series data to interpret, monitor and predict their long-term behavior.
OpenBDLM includes an anomaly detection tool which allows to detect abnormal behavior in a fully probabilistic framework.
OpenBDLM handles time series with missing data and non-uniform timestep vector.
OpenBDLM is available for download from GitHub at \url{https://github.com/CivML-PolyMtl/OpenBDLM}.\\
